                        <p>I have worked alot on this page for some weeks now, and i think it looks great now. The page has alot of content, but how useful the content is thats another story; yes I'm thinking about the tennis racket :P </p>

                        <h3>The fun of errors</h3>
                        <p>I just had some fun with the JavaScript code connected to the index page. I struggled with getting the script to do what I wanted it to do, but in the end I found out what was the cause of my error. I had confused document.getElementById() with document.getElementsById() some places. This goes to show that it just takes a letter to give you hours of fun.</p>

                        <h3>Just bought the domain</h3>
                        <p>As of this moment i own the domain tmholen.com, and this page will be open for the public when the domain start working properly. I got a bit annoyed when i found out that I had to wait 24 hours before the domain, but that was mostly because I wasted a around hour trying to make my page work in the file manager...</p>
